title: Renal Trauma
---

### `Remember`
- The kidneys = most common genitourinary organs injured from external trauma
- Motor vehicle accidents, falls from heights, and assaults contribute to the majority of *blunt* renal trauma.
- *Direct transmission of kinetic energy and rapid deceleration forces* places the kidneys at risk.
- *Penetrating* renal injuries most often comes from gunshot and stab wounds.
- Bullet size and velocity has the *greatest* effect on soft tissue damage as predicted by the following equation:
  - Kinetic Energy = ½·mass·velocity<sup>2</sup>
- The *best indicators* of significant urinary system injury = `haematuria`
  - *Microscopic:* > 5 RBCs/HPF or positive dipstick finding
  - *Gross hematuria and hypotension:* SP < 90 mm Hg

	*The degree of hematuria and severity of renal injury do* **not** *consistently correlate*

### `Grade`

### `Indication of renal imaging:`

1. All **penetrating** trauma patients with a likelihood of renal injury (abdomen, flank, or low chest) who are **hemodynamically stable**.
1. All **blunt** trauma with significant mechanism of injury, specifically **rapid deceleration**.
1. All **blunt** trauma with **gross hematuria**.
1. All **blunt** trauma with **hypotension** ( SP < 90 mm Hg) at any time during evaluation and resuscitation.
1. All **pediatric** patients with > 5 RBCs/HPF.

- Patients with microscopic hematuria without shock can be observed clinically *without imaging studies*.
- Penetrating injuries with any degree of hematuria should be *imaged*.

### `Imaging:`

**`CECT`**

- `gold` standard
- *Highly* sensitive and specific
- Provides *most definitive* staging information:
  - Parenchymal lacerations clearly defined.
  - *Extravasation* of Contrast enhanced urine easily be detected.
  - *Associated injuries* to the bowel, pancreas, liver, spleen, and other organs identified.
  - *Degree of retroperitoneal* bleeding assessed.
  - *Lack of uptake of contrast material in the parenchyma* suggests arterial injury.

  ------------------------------------------------------

- Findings on CT that *raise suspicion for major injury:*
  1. Medial hematoma, suggesting vascular injury.
  1. Medial urinary extravasation, suggesting renal pelvis or ureteropelvic junction avulsion injury.
  1. Lack of contrast enhancement of the parenchyma, suggesting arterial injury.

**`IVP:`**

- When the surgeon encounters an unexpected retroperitoneal hematoma surrounding a kidney during abdominal exploration.

### `Management:`

**`Operative management:`**

- Absolute indications
  1. Hemodynamic instability with shock
  1. Expanding/pulsatile renal hematoma
  1. Suspected renal pedicle avulsion (grade 5)
  1. Ureteropelvic junction disruption
- Relative indications (rare)
  1. Urinary extravasation together with nonviable tissue
  1. Renal injury together with colon/pancreatic injury
  1. A delayed diagnosis of arterial injury (which most likely will need delayed nephrectomy)
  1. The management of the intraoperative nonexpanding retroperitoneal hematoma is controversial → *Nonoperative therapy is recommended, regardless of mechanism*
  1. *Urinary extravasation from grade IV parenchymal laceration or forniceal rupture can be managed nonoperatively* - spontaneous resolution *> 90%*
  1. *Nonviable tissue > 25%* with parenchymal laceration or urinary extravasation or both = *operative* management is recommended
  1. *Segmental renal artery injury with renal laceration results in nonviable tissue (> 20%)* → Currently, nonoperative management is favored in hemodynamically stable patientss, although concerns include delayed bleeding and urinoma formation

`Renal exploration:`

- Surgical exploration of the acutely injured kidney is best done by a transabdominal approach, which allows complete inspection of intra abdominal organs and bowel.

`Renal reconstruction:`

- The principles of renal reconstruction:
	- *Complete* renal exposure, measures for temporary vascular control, *debridement* of nonviable tissue
	- *Hemostasis* by individual suture ligation of bleeding vessels
	- *Watertight closure* of the collecting system if possible
	- *Coverage* or reapproximation of the parenchymal defect
	- *Judicious use of drains*
