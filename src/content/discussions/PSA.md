#### <span class='text-danger'>What is serum PSA?</span>

- Also called <span class='text-danger'>y-seminoprotein / HKK~3 </span>
- PSA (prostate specific antigen) is a glycoprotein, acts as serine protease / arginine protease.
- Molecular weight = 33 KD (contain 7% carbohydrate,240 amino acid).
- Found exclusively in epithelial cell of prostate.
- <span class='text-danger'>**Functions:**</span> lyse the clot in ejaculate (liquefaction), release of spermatozoa from coagulum of semen.
- PSA gene (HKK~3) located in chromosome no 9
- <span class='text-danger'>*Ectopic secretion of PSA*</span> seen in: breast CA, nodular breast tissue, breast milk, adrenal & renal CA, female serum.
- PSA is organ specific not cancer specific.
- <span class='text-danger'>**Normal level of serum PSA:**</span> 1-4 ng/ml in male (50-80 yrs without prostatic disease)
- Serum PSA become <span class='text-success'>*detectable at puberty*</span> with ↑LH & testosterone hormone.
- In male without BPH - change in PSA = .04ng/ml/year
- In male with BPH - change in PSA = .07- .27 ng/ml/year (between 60-80 years of age)
- <span class='text-danger'>**Ejaculation in male**</span> (>50years of age)- <span class='text-success'>*increases PSA*</span>; so repeat test after 48hrs sexual abstinence is helpful.
- Pt taking 5α reductase inhibitor but PSA increasing - indicate occult malignancy.
- <span class='text-primary'>28% male with BPH = PSA value more than 4 ng/ml</span>
- <span class='text-danger'>Statins decrease PSA by decreasing lipid</span>
- PSA should be multiplied with <span class='text-warning'>**2** after *6 months of treatment with Dutasteride*</span>, with **2.3** after *2 years*, with **2.5** after *7 years*.
- <span class='text-danger'>**PSAD(PSA density)**</span> = serum PSA / Prostate Volume; if ≥ .15,require prostate biopsy ( if PSA = 4-10ng/ml & DRE normal).
- **PSA velocity** – if > .75ng/ml/yr in male require prostate biopsy.
- 20% pt with PSA > 20ng/ml & 75% with PSA > 50ng/ml have lymph node metastasis.
- NCCN guidelines= <span class='text-primary'>*bone scan to be done if -*</span>
 - <span class='text-danger'>PSA > 20ng/ml, or</span>
 - <span class='text-danger'>Gleason’s score 8-10, or</span>
 - <span class='text-danger'>clinical stage T3/ T4, or</span>
 - <span class='text-danger'>clinical symptoms like bone pain,</span>
 - <span class='text-danger'>Alkaline phosphatase.</span>
