title: Dilemma in Diagnosis of CA Prostate
---

#### `D-1) Persistently raised PSA and single negative prostate biopsy:`

**what next?**

- The *first step is to assess adequacy* of initial biopsy –

	which depends on:

	1. No and location of biopsy cores taken, length of each core,quality of tissue sampled.
	1. Size of prostate (chance of finding any cancer is inversely related to prosate size).

- what next = **repeat biopsy**.

	**but why?**

	- Detection rate on repeat biopsy will be **2 fold higher** in an12 core extended biopsy scheme- (AUA 2012).
	- Upto **30%** improved detection rate on RPB (EAU-2013).

#### `D-2) Role of new biochemical marker:`

Aim is to reduce unnecessary Repeat biopsy.

- **NCCN guideline** (EAU 2013)

	%fPSA ( in pt with total PSA 4-10 ng/ml) | Prostate Biopsy (PB)
	-----------------------------------------|---------------------
	≤10%                                     | Do PB
	.>10 - ≤25%                              | Intermediate
	≥25%                                     | No PB

- **FDA approval**

	**Progensa PCA3 assay**

	- *what is this ?*
	  - This is <span class='text-danger'>PCA3 score</span> = ( PCA3 RNA/PSA RNA)
	- Cut off value=25, in post DRE 1^st catch urine. (some used-cut off=35)
	- *For whom?*
	  - <span class='text-success'>Male ≥50 yrs, one or more negative PBs, again highly suspicious for prostatic CA.</span>
	- *why?*
	  1. CA detection rate 6% at PCA3 <5 to 57% at PCA3 >100.
	  1. Sensitivity & specificity of PCA3 score of 35 are- 48% & 78% who underwent 10 core 2 sets repeat PB at 2 & 4 yr follow up.
	  1. Superior than %fPSA.

#### `D-3) Dilemma if initial bx showed HGPIN (15-20%):`

**What next ?**
- Single core
  - No RPB
  - Why?
	  - Because unrelated to Pca risk
- Multifocal
  - RPB within 1 yr after initial bx
  - “Delayed interval” PB every 3 yrs-( GODOY et al).
  - Why?
	  - Because risk of CA on RPB - 40%

#### `D-4) Dilemma if initial bx showed - ASAP (5%):`

**What next?**

- RPB within 3-6 months

**Why?**

- Because 40% chance of cancer detection on RPB.

#### `D-5) Dilemma in techniques / no of cores / sampling location during initial bx:`

<span class='text-primary'>**Sextant? / 10 cores? / 12 cores? / more?**</span>

*Current recommendation:*

- <span class='text-success'>10-12 core extended PB scheme, with additional cores from suspected area on DRE/TRUS is the most accepted method.</span>

	(some authors recommend adding a core from <span class='text-primary'>extreme apex</span> on each side, because this is the *m/c* site where CA is missed during initial bx)

**What is extended PB scheme?**

sextant template + at least 4 & up to 8 laterally directed sampling from PZ.

Usually <span class='text-success'>12 cores</span>.

**Advantage?**

Superior detection rate.

**Vienna nomogram** suggested (8-18) cores, based on pt age & gland volume, in PSA 2-10 ng/ml to ensure 90% certainty.

(for example= prostate size of 50-60 ml in pt <50yrs, 50s, 60s, 70s- 16, 14, 12 or 10 cores were prescribed respectively)

*Most initial bx shown = further increase in no of bx core >12 has no significant benefit.*

#### `D-6) Repeat PB – what’s the optimal technique?`

- <span class='text-danger'>**Controversial.**</span>
- <span class='text-primary'>*Recommendation*</span> is 10-12 cores extended bx, with additional core from suspected area by modern imaging.

Recently Scattoni et al developed some model,

Pt with previous ASAP       | Pt with %fPSA <10%        | Pt with %fPSA>10% but no ASAP
----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------
14 core without TZ sampling | 14 core bx with 4 TZ core | 20 core bx with 4 TZ core

`Algorithm for pt with prior negative biopsy (AUA updates 2012-1)`


- Assessing the **adequacy of initial biopsy**.

	↓

- **F/T PSA** is currently the **most useful** for predicting cancer on repeat biopsy.

	(Newer marker such as PCA-3 and %(-2) proPSA are promising)

	↓

- **Repeat bx include a minimum of 14 cores**

	(12 cores recommended for initial biopsy plus 2 additional core from right and left anterior apex)

	(The yeild from transition zone is low)

	↓

- **Fail to identify CA**

	↓

- **Saturation biopsy (>20 cores) is warranted**

	- <span class='text-primary'>After 2 negative saturation biopsy , finding of cancer is extremely low and if found, the significance of the cancer is questionable.</span>

`mp-MRI – (Multiparametric-MRI) for Prostate-malignancy`

- Includes T1 and T2 weighted sequences with at least 2 functional parameters–

	- dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE),

	- diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI),

	- apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping

	- and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

`Q) Does mpMRI have a role in ruling-in and ruling-out clinically significant prostate cancer in men at risk prior to biopsy ?`

- MRI may rule out significant cancer and avoid a second biopsy series in case of persistent elevated PSA.

- There is clear evidence that targeting biopsies to areas suspicious for malignancy at mpMRI can *reveal a greater volume of cancers and a higher grade* than systematic 12-core biopsies.

Pt had high PSA & negative TRUS–bx. Later Cancer confirmed on MR-bx

`MRI for the Detection, Localisation, and Characterisation of Prostate Cancer:`

*Recommendations from a European Consensus Meeting–*

- Diffusion weighted MR (DW-MR) sequence is **appropriate** in detection of any cancer in PZ
- The Gleason grade of lesions in the PZ
 1. *exclusion of clinically significant disease as defined by a lesion size ≥0.2 cm3 (approximately 7 mm) in PZ,*
 1. *exclusion of clinically significant disease as defined by a lesion size ≥0.5ml, in the PZ &*
 1. *exclusion of clinically significant cancer according to the definition of a lesion ≥0.5 cm3 and/or Gleason ≥4 + 3 in the PZ.*

`TRUS (Trans Rectal Ultrasonography):`

- Uses:
 1. Biopsy
 1. Cancer Screening
 1. Prostate Gland Measurement and Calculation PSA Gland Density
- Advantages:
 1. Simple out-patient procedure
 1. Reasonably well tolerated
 1. Inexpensive
- Disadvantages:
 1. Low sensitivity, low PPV
 1. Large inter-observer variability
 1. Trans-rectal approach is irritable for some

#### `D-7) Diagnostic dilemma in histopathology report following robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy:`

- There are reports in literature about the <span class='text-primary'>*‘vanishing cancer syndrome’*</span> - the phenomenon of not finding any cancer in the radical prostatectomy specimen, despite a positive needle biopsy.
 - This has important medico legal implications-
 - Pt may feel that surgery has been performed unnecessarily or worse, still that cancer has been left behind in their body.
- Many benign conditions like Benign atrophy, post-atrophic hyperplasia, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, seminal vesicle-type tissue, Cowper’s gland, and inflammatory processes like granulomatous prostatitis, xanthogranulomatous prostatitis and malakoplakia may be misinterpreted as adenocarcinoma in initial bx.
 - In such cases use of *immunohistochemical stains like p63, CAM 5.2, 34βE12 and AMACR* may help in diagnosis.
